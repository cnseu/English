Finally I find I have so many error many time‘s  word.  like assemble , aspect.  I think I don't know this word because I don't know what is mean. And I know less words. I don't have 耐心 to remember. So I need pay more and more times to change it. That's it

I have many wrong words. I can't remember because I don't understand what they mean. My patience is insufficient, so I need to spend more time on it.

Some words I always write wrong.  Like assemble,aspect，provoke,period. I can't remember it because I don't know understand what they mean. And my patience need update. So I need to spend more time on it. Maybe make a word card can help me. Maybe write many times can help me. All in all I am lazy.

Why do I always forget words?

There are some words I always write incorrectly. I can‘t remember what that they mean and hardly use it them. Like assemble,aspect，provoke,period./For instance, 'assemble', 'aspect', 'provoke', and 'period'. I can't remember them because I don't know understand what they mean. And my patience need update. So I need to spend more time on it. I need to work on my patience and I need to spend more time on learning them. Maybe make a word card can help me. Maybe write many times can help me. Maybe making flashcards will help me. Maybe writing them out a number of times will help me. All in all I am lazy./But the problem is that I am lazy.

Why Forget words
There are some words I always write incorrectly. I can‘t remember what they mean and hardly use them. For instance ,'assemble','aspect'. I can't remember them because I don't understand what they mean. I need to work on my patience and I need to spend more time on learning them. Maybe making flashcards will help me. Maybe writing them out a number of times will help me. But the problem is that I am lazy.

How study
Few days ago. I find a new way to remember words.Spacing learning sessions apart and Varying the settings in which learning takes place.My friends always like write note. But not useful.why?  Because they don't really think about it. Me too . I write too many note. Never recall it.So I need to study review.

Try to make some links in my head.Try to use remember word to influence in my head.The amazing ,laughing,hating words will hard forget. Try to change pointless things become rewarding.Sometimes I think i aleardy know it. Actually I don't know or I just know few minute.What's really know. I think really know it's know it forever and it can help you recall and useful.

it is changing the way the world learns foreign languages

日常反思
几天前，我发现换一个环境学习是个好办法。在家的时候，父母总是吵架，水管嗡嗡响，外边车声不断，扰的我心神不宁。但在学校图书馆，我能学进去。

以前总是记笔记，但是帮助很小，因为我很少复习它，并且上课的时候净记笔记了，老师说的话我都没理解，或者说我只是记住了几分钟。同时我也画了很多重点，但每次复习的时候都感觉整本书都是重点，还得从头开始，这个时候我就会心不在焉。所以我需要提前预习和准备，在课上花更多的时间去理解老师的话，减少输入，增加输出，主动的去梳理脉络，思考更多的例子，而不是被动的接受。

还有就是背了单词老忘，我想我要把无意义的内容转换成有意义的内容与大脑联系起来，在脑海里建立一栋想象的大厦，并让我记忆的东西充满其中。

Few days ago. I found a good way to study. Changing learning environment.

When I at home. My parient quarrel every day, and under my house has so many cars.So noise.But in school library.,I can study. There have so many study people. Library make me have a sense of crisis.I always feel i am in a compete when i am in library.So study in library it‘s very efficient for me.

I used to like write note.I was taking notes all time when I was in class.But it help me a little. First I write note all time. Second I never review it. I spend less time think what teacher say. And then I drow so much point on my book. Actually,it not help me. When exam coming I feed the book is all point. I need start at the book ’s first page to last page.That distract my heart.So i need preview, spend more time to think what teacher say. Reduce input, increase output. Think more example rather than passive acceptance.

Finally,I need make meaningless to meaningful in my head. Make it links. Build a large building in my head and fill my memories.
